Viewer 3D
^^^^^^^^^
In a single crystal experiment, the first step is to gain an overview of the system. This is most often done by performing an A3 scan with the sample in a specific scattering plane. Due to the 2D detector of DMC, such an A3 scan produces a 3D set of measured data points. In the frame of reference of the instrument, the majority of the covered volume is in the Qx-Qy plane, i.e. with Qz close to zero. A single A3 slices corresponds to a curved line in th Qx-Qy  together with a symmetrically curved line in Qz. This sheet is then rotated around the origin with each A3 step. Without an UB matrix, we can first look at the data in Q-space. This is done by having rlu=False.

Interactivity
-------------
The Viewer 3D is an interactive plotting function which allows a look through the data in steps along the three major axes. In the current build, these are along Qx, Qy, and Qz, and once can change between them by clicking keys on the keyboard as tabulated below

The above code takes the data from a A3 scan and generates the Viewer 3D utilizing a voxel size of 0.01 x 0.01 x 0.01 A:math:`^{-3}`. By default, the viewer starts out in projection 2, i.e. with Qz being the axis stepped through. When handling the data directly it is more convenient to utilize the keyboard shortcuts but in a scripting interface these are not available. Instead one can utilize the *.setPlane* and *.changeAxis* methods. In addition, the color scale has been tweaked such that weaker peaks are visible. It is possible to slightly tweak the color scale directly in the Viewer 3D by using the sliders to the right of the color bar. Notice: When saving the figure these slides are rendered invisible. The end results are shown below:
